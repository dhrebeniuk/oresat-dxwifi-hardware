RF layer1, layer 2 GND
thickness of roger determines line width
ground must be continuous under RF traces, keep away from RF
flood 5V power on layer 3
routing on layer 3 and layer 4
ground on same layer as RF needs to 2x dialelectric thickness(distance between RF and GND) away. Try for >30 mils

Questions:
Special considerations for power/ground pins on RF ICs?
3.3V power plane would remove a bunch of resistors
component pads centered on RF trace?
Sunstone annular ring size
GND pads within keepout, should I use a long GND trace or a close via?
different switch and header footprint?
no solder mask on traces
RF trace adjacent vias in pads
more caps on the SMPS?
power select header needs another position for lab supply in?
Do high power ground header pins need thermals?
Do I need thermals on ground plane?
Add an extra test for how traces are necked into pads?
update PSAS logo with silk circle

TO-DO
DONE Power Divider resistor
DONE change ref des on SMPS to original
approved DRC errors
smaller vias!

NEW TODO:
DONE Window tCream
DONE number header


NEWER TODO:
DONE Label LEDs
DONE move vias out of stub keepout
DONE breakoff holes aligned with edge
DONE fix tDoc on logic section
DONE change traces on logic to .2 and use bottom layer
DONE pull in vias around caps on boost converter and check for small clearances
DONE make tCream bigger on PA. 
DONE Move vias out of tStop on PA footprint 
DONE change width of tStop on RF traces
DONE via spacing at 1.5mm to let 5v through
