RF layer1, layer 2 GND
thickness of roger determines line width
ground must be continuous under RF traces, keep away from RF
flood 5V power on layer 3
routing on layer 3 and layer 4
ground on same layer as RF needs to 2x dialelectric thickness(distance between RF and GND) away. Try for >30 mils

Questions:
Special considerations for power/ground pins on RF ICs?
3.3V power plane would remove a bunch of resistors
component pads centered on RF trace?
Sunstone annular ring size
GND pads within keepout, should I use a long GND trace or a close via?
different switch and header footprint?
no solder mask on traces
RF trace adjacent vias in pads
more caps on the SMPS?
power select header needs another position for lab supply in?
Do high power ground header pins need thermals?
Do I need thermals on ground plane?
Add an extra test for how traces are necked into pads?
