RF layer1, layer 2 GND
thickness of roger determines line width
ground must be continuous under RF traces, keep away from RF
flood 5V power on layer 3
routing on layer 3 and layer 4
ground on same layer as RF needs to 2x dialelectric thickness(distance between RF and GND) away. Try for >30 mils

Questions:
Special considerations for power/ground pins on RF ICs?
Does L1 need to be that large?
3.3V power plane would remove a bunch of resistors
Does detector output of power divider need the same RF considerations?
Specific rogers type and thickness
Dielectric thickness
How should a fatter trace leave a skinny pad?
component pads centered on RF trace?
Sunstone annular ring size
